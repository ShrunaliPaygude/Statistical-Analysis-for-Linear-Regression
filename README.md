# Statistical-Analysis-for-Linear-Regression
We have National Football league data which is provided in the data section, and we have to construct statistical analysis for linear regression and answer some questions related to the data.
I will be using Minitab for the analysis part, you can use R or SAS for the same!
For any queries regarding using minitab, please get in touch with me via https://github.com/ShrunaliPaygude

a. Fitting a multiple linear regression model relating the number of games won to the
team’s passing yardage (x2), the percentage of rushing plays (x7), and the opponents’
yards rushing (x8).

b. Construct the analysis-of-variance table and test for significance of regression.
c. Calculate t statistics for testing the hypotheses H0: β2 = 0, H0: β7 = 0, and
0. What conclusions can you draw about the roles the variables x2, x7, and x8
the model?
d. Calculate R2 and for this model.
e. Using the partial F test, determine the contribution of x7 to the model. How is this
partial F statistic related to the t test for β7 calculated in part c above?
